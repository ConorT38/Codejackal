This site was part of a project for our Second year Web Development, it functions as a tutorial/Q&A type site oriented around programming and general computing. 
It has a 'like' system incorporated with a leaderboard, and also awarding badges for the users points(acquired by likes,shares etc).

The CSS framework used is Bootstrap, and the server-side language is PHP5.
